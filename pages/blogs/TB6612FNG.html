          <h2>A review on the TB6612FNG H-Bridge</h2>

          <p>
            I was in search of an effective H-bridge that would drive two motors
            in my Arduino project. After careful consideration, I chose the
            TB6612FNG. Among others, this was due to its features and
            efficiency, besides compatibility with the requirement of the
            project.
          </p>

          <p>
            The TB6612FNG is a dual motor driver able to drive two motors at up
            to 1.2A of constant current. It's a cheap and easy way to get your
            motors running. This H-bridge allows not just controlling the
            direction and speed of your motors, but also stopping and braking.
            Motor working voltage in the range from 2.7 to 13.5V. It also
            features built-in overheat shut-off and undervoltage detection
            circuits. Compared to other commercially available H-bridges, the
            TB6612FNG has the upper hand. First, it has a higher efficiency
            rating at 91 to 95%. Second, it is versatile in that it can be used
            to drive two motors at a time.

          <p>
            Finally, it's user-friendly with well laid out and clearly marked
            pinouts. Now, just like all components do, the TB6612FNG has its
            limitations. For instance, it cannot operate on applications that
            require more than 1.2A of continuous current. Further, even with the
            ability to run as low as 2.5V, it is derated on performance. In
            general, the TB6612FNG is a pretty good H-bridge for most Arduino
            projects since it is efficient, versatile, and fairly user-friendly.
            But, as with most things, component choice really needs to be based
            on your exact needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            When compared to the L298N, the TB6612FNG is more efficient,
            smaller, and features a low-current standby mode. However, the L298N
            can handle larger motors and operates at a higher voltage and
            continuous current rating. Therefore, the choice between the two
            depends on the specific requirements of your project. While the
            TB6612FNG is ideal for projects requiring efficiency and
            space-saving, the L298N is better suited for applications requiring
            the control of larger motors or higher power.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many other H-bridges that work better for other
            usesâ€”chiefly those intended for special features or more power. This
            makes comparison and checking of the contrast between different
            H-bridges quite handy before making a final decision. Overall, the TB6612FNG H-bridge 
            is a great choice for my use cases.
          </p>

          <p>
           One last thing, you can check out my github for a library based off of this H-bridge, it uses 
           the serial-monitor to control the motors.
