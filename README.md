# Ali-s-Portfolio
My own personal portfolio based website. Its quite simple, I programmed it in HTML and CSS with a bit of JS to the side! Soon enough I will tinker with frameworks, such as React.JS (or Next.JS) or Angular. Although simple, this is quite a larger project for me and its a great oppurtinuty for my own learning.
